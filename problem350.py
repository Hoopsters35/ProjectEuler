# A list of size n is a sequence of n natural numbers. Examples are (2,4,6), (2,6,4), (10,6,15,6), and (11).

# 
The greatest common divisor, or gcd, of a list is the largest natural number that divides all entries of the list. Examples: gcd(2,6,4) = 2, gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1 and gcd(11) = 11.

# 
The least common multiple, or lcm, of a list is the smallest natural number divisible by each entry of the list. Examples: lcm(2,6,4) = 12, lcm(10,6,15,6) = 30 and lcm(11) = 11.
