# We define a simber to be a positive integer in which any odd digit, if present, occurs an odd number of times, and any even digit, if present, occurs an even number of times.
# For example, 141221242 is a 9-digit simber because it has three 1's, four 2's and two 4's. 
# Let Q(n) be the count of all simbers with at most n digits.
# You are given Q(7) = 287975 and Q(100) mod 1 000 000 123 = 123864868.
