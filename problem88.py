# A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 × a2 × ... × ak.
# For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
# For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
# k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
