# Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10 like this:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12....

# Consider the digit d=1. After we write down each number n, we will update the number of ones that have occurred and call this number f(n,1). The first values for f(n,1), then, are as follows:
# Note that f(n,1) never equals 3.

So the first two solutions of the equation f(n,1)=n are n=0 and n=1. The next solution is n=199981.
