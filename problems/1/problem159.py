# A composite number can be factored many different ways.  
For instance, not including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:
# Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding together the digits of that number, 
and repeating that process until a number is arrived at that is less than 10.  
Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.
# We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the individual factors of our number.
 The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.
