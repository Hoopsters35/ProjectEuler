# The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of numbers with the special property that its square ends with the same digits: 3762 = 141376. Let's call a number with this property a steady square.
# Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems. In the base 14 numbering system, the 3-digit number c37 is also a steady square: c372 = aa0c37, and the sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the same numbering system. The letters a, b, c and d are used for the 10, 11, 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar to the hexadecimal numbering system.
