# 
It can be shown that the polynomial n4 + 4n3 + 2n2 + 5n is a multiple of 6 for every integer n. It can also be shown that 6 is the largest integer satisfying this property.

# 
Define M(a, b, c) as the maximum m such that n4 + an3 + bn2 + cn is a multiple of m for all integers n. For example, M(4, 2, 5) = 6.
