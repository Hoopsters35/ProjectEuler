# Let n be a positive integer.
A 6-sided die is thrown n times. Let c be the number of pairs of consecutive throws that give the same value.
# For example, if n = 7 and the values of the die throws are (1,1,5,6,6,6,3), then the following pairs of consecutive throws give the same value:
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
Therefore, c = 3 for (1,1,5,6,6,6,3).
