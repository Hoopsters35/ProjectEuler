# 
We define a permutation as an operation that rearranges the order of the elements {1, 2, 3, ..., n}.
There are n! such permutations, one of which leaves the elements in their initial order.
For n = 3 we have 3! = 6 permutations:
- P1 = keep the initial order
- P2 = exchange the 1st and 2nd elements
- P3 = exchange the 1st and 3rd elements
- P4 = exchange the 2nd and 3rd elements
- P5 = rotate the elements to the right
- P6 = rotate the elements to the left
