Anton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.
However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the rules somewhat.
They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a proper divisor of the number of stones present in the pile. E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains 24 stones they may take only 1,2,3,4,6,8 or 12 stones from that pile.
So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.
The first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.
