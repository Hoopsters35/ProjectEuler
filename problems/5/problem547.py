# Assuming that two points are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) within a rectangle, it is possible to determine the expected value of the distance between these two points.
# For example, the expected distance between two random points in a unit square is about 0.521405, while the expected distance between two random points in a rectangle with side lengths 2 and 3 is about 1.317067.
